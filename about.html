        <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="aboutText"> There is a strong connection between taste and emotion. Different flavours can evoke
            different
            emotional responses in people. For example, the taste of sweet foods can often trigger feelings of
            happiness and contentment, while bitter flavours may trigger feelings of disgust. The sense of taste is
            closely tied to the sense of smell, and the combination of these two senses can have a powerful
            impact on how we experience food and drink, and how it makes us feel emotionally. Additionally,
            certain flavours and aromas may be associated with memories or experiences, which can also
            influence our emotional response to them.
            This project is based on the FaceReader data gathering sessions at TestLab, which was initiated to
            test out the FaceReader program and to investigate the link between tasting different flavours and
            changes in emotions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Assignment</h3>
        <p class="aboutText">
            The aim of this assignment is to use the data collected in the previous study, which examined
            consumer emotions in the tasting of cocktails. In this assignment, the presented data needs to be
            analysed. As a result, solutions will be provided about how the data can be presented in a clear
            manner to different audiences and to explain the results of this study by the means of visual artifacts.
        </p>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Results</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            This project will be executed within the parameters given by the minor Data Visualisation. The results
            will consist of the following elements:
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp A portfolio where every step will be documented, and choices will be explained.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp An interactive visualization of the data in the form of a website.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp A poster presentation where the results of the project are presented.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Data</h3>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Collection of the data</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            A dataset of 57 respondents is available on a cocktail experiment, performed by the Research Center
            Future of Food.
            <br> The data is collected by asking each participant to sit in front of a laptop. This laptop was
            running the
            FaceReader software which started recording once the process had been explained. Three samples of
            cocktails, a glass of water to drink in between cocktails and a questionnaire were set in front of the
            participants. The participants where then asked to sample each cocktail and fill out the questionnaire
            about the flavors tasted and the emotions felt. The participant was thanked for their participation
            and the FaceReader recording was stopped.
            <br> The FaceReader software produced per participant a dataset of 7 different emotions recorded every
            33 milliseconds. Every emotion has a number ranging from 0 to 1 based on how strongly the
            FaceReader software measured that emotion on the participants face.
            <br> The total number of participants were 56 numbered 2 to 27, this was done because the first session
            was a trial conducted by the researcher to test the FaceReader software.
        </p>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Neutralization of the data</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            Filtering the data was a collaboration with 3 other project groups. This was necessary because of the
            extreme large amount of data that was not necessary for this project and the desired visualization
            but included in the dataset.
            <br> In the Excel document provided there were, depending on the length of the video, a number of rows
            with measured emotions for every 33 milliseconds. In the video there were times where the
            participant was smelling a cocktail, drinking a cocktail and writing down their experiences. The
            emotions measured at the moments where the participant was writing, are not interesting for the
            results in this project. By watching the videos individually, and writing down what time frames are
            not interesting, it was possible to filter these rows of data out. In addition to this, timestamps
            needed to be added to the data marking when a participant is smelling a specific cocktail (cocktail 1,
            2 or 3), and when a participant is drinking a specific cocktail. This part of filtering the data was
            done
            with all the project groups, dividing the work made it possible to get the data within a few days
            instead of a longer period.
            <br>To make the data even more usable for the specific need in this project, the faulty data was
            removed. There were a few moments were the FaceReader was not able to read the emotions
            correctly. Whether it came from the participant looking away or the reflection of glasses. This data
            was deleted, giving a smaller but more correct output.
            <br> In the end, the “smelling a cocktail” and “drinking a cocktail” event markers were merged in a
            “experiencing the cocktail” event marker. This was more suitable for the way the data is presented in
            this project. More about the presentation of the data can be found in the chapter Result and
            conclusion.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Method</h3>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Agile</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            The agile work method will be used in this project. This means that every week there will be a recap
            of what was done in the previous week, wat will be done in the next week, and if the project will
            succeed if the process continues at the same speed.
            <br> In addition, feedback and support will be provided every Thursday by the teachers.
        </p>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Requirements</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            The general requirements of the project given by the client are as following:
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp Data needs to be visualized in a way that it is clear to the viewer what is presented.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp Visualization needs to be made for a specific target audience.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp Different visualizations made for different target audiences.
            <br> <br> These are requirements that must be included in the project which means they create the scope
            of
            the project.
        </p>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Target audience</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            There were a few target audiences that needed to be addressed for the research. These were the
            scientific audience, the consumers, the general public or others that could benefit from the results.
            Every individual project group was allowed to make the choice of target audience for themselves but
            taking into consideration the choices of others.
            <br> In the beginning of the project there were a few sketches made. These were not yet connected to a
            specific audience. Gradually it became clear that the main idea in the sketches was targeted to the
            scientific audience. In consultation with the client the decision was made to cater to the target
            audience “scientific audience”. The choices form the other groups (3 other groups) were taken in
            consideration. Luckily all the groups were divided among the other options. The sketches can be
            found in the chapter Result and conclusion, and in the appendix.
        </p>
        <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Color decisions</h4>
        <p class="aboutText">
            After gathering a lot of information considering colors and the common use of them, the colors of
            the emotions were set to specific values. The information was gathered from How a Film Color
            Palette Can Make You a Better Filmmaker [W/ Infographics], 2023), (Risk, 2020), (Color Psychology:
            The Emotional Effects of Colors, 2023), (Vetter, 2019) and (How Translating Colors Across Cultures
            Can Help You Make a Positive Impact, 2020).
            <br /> To start the decision for happy and angry was made. Based on the “green is good and red is bad”
            theory, we picked green for the emotion happy and red for the emotion angry. After that, the color
            grey was picked for the emotion neutral because grey represents neutrality. Next up, the emotion
            sad needed to get a color. Blue often represents sadness or depression. Because of this, blue was
            picked for the emotion sad.
            <br /> Even though green often represents good, it could also represent the emotion disgusted. However,
            we already chose green for the emotion happy. That is why we had to look for another color
            representing disgusted. In addition to this, the emotions surprised and scared still needed to get a
            color. With the theory that yellow, on some occasions, can represent happiness and being surprised
            is not a negative emotion in the basis, yellow was picked for the emotion surprised. To get a color
            palette that is pleasing to the eye, orange and purple were a good match to add to the existing
            colors. These two colors were picked and distributed on instincts, because the articles were too
            indecisive on these colors and emotions. Choosing purple for the emotion disgusted and orange for
            the emotion scared was the best option.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Result and conclusion</h3>
        <p class="aboutText">
            After the first client meeting, the target audience that was going to be address was decided upon.
            Because of this, the scope was limited to a couple of sketches that were going to be incorporated in
            the final product. This was going to be some form of a scatterplot (Image 1. Sketch visualization
            home page with filters and time slider), preferably with options to play through time, and a line
            graph (Image 2. Sketch visualization emotions per participant per cocktail through time) showing
            emotions through time.

            <br /><br />
            The next step was to neutralize the data. As mentioned, this was done by combining effort with all
            the other project groups. After the data was neutralized, the first iteration of the website could be
            started. The first version consisted of a scatterplot (Image 3. First iteration scatterplot) where all
            the
            data was put into one big graph regardless of time, cocktail, or participant.
            <br />
            <img src="img/paper/image3.jpg" alt="First iteration scatterplot" class="aboutimage">
            <br />
            Image 3. First iteration scatterplot
            <br /><br />
            Of course, this was totally unusable and impossible to read any kind of information from this
            graph.
            So, the next step was to filter the data based
            on its time stamp and cocktail. Filtering on
            the time stamp was more difficult than
            anticipated. This was because not all users
            drank and smelled each cocktail for the same
            amount of time or at all.
            <br />
            There were a couple of routes that could be
            taken. All the participants could pop in and
            out of the graph when they were
            experiencing the cocktail, or all the time could
            be scaled. And the smelling and tasting of the
            cocktail could be separated into different segments
            or they could be grouped together. Because it was
            the goal to visualize how the participants
            experienced the cocktails through time, the choice
            was made to scale the data to one length of the
            slider and to group the tasting and smelling of the
            cocktail together. This was accomplished with some
            slight alterations in the dataset. This also results in
            that the program visualizes every participants’
            actions in chronological order, no matter if they tasted or smelled the cocktail first (Image 4. Second
            iteration scatterplot).

            Image 4. Second iteration scatterplot
            <br /><br />
            After scaling, filtering, and adding a time slider, the scatterplot started to take some shape. The
            filtering of the data by user based on emotion, gender and age range was added as well as an
            automatic play function.
            <br />
            The goal was to also add a more detailed line graph view per participant. This way, the emotions of
            each individual participant could be viewed through time. To accomplish this, functionality was
            added to the scatterplot where a user could hover their mouse over a dot. This creates a box where
            more information about that dot is shown like the participant it belonged to and the age of the
            participant. Users could also click on each dot to go to another page. On this page a line graph was
            created for a more detailed view. This graph includes a legend for each emotion, but no further
            filtering options.
            <br />
            At this point, the design of the website was changed to something that looks professional yet
            resembles the subject of the study. The final colors were also chosen. These still follow the results of
            the color decision research but were slightly altered to be less harsh to look at and to generally look
            more pleasing.
            <br />
            Because there was some time left and it felt like this was an important part of the research, the
            decision was made to add a bar chart to the website. This shows the average emotion from all the
            participants per cocktail. Explanatory text was also added as well as an about page.
            <br />
            The final result is a complete website with scientific oriented visual representations of the results
            from the TasteLab research. On the first screen the user is immediately presented with the
            interactive scatterplot visual which automatically starts playing (Image 3. Website homepage).
            Beneath the visual there are several filtering options and an explanatory text about the visual. At the
            bottom of the page is a bar chart with average emotions per cocktail. If a user interacts with the
            scatterplot visual, they are sent to another page with a more detailed view from that participant. At
            the top right of the first page, there is an information button which sends the user to a page
            containing more details about the project.

            Hello there, nice to meet you!
            <br> We are Sjoerd Hendriks and Manon Schüle. We are in our 4th year of the
            bachelor IT study at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences. Within the minor Data Visualization and with the
            help of our
            client Dr. Danny Han we executed this project. This project took place from 06-02-2023 until 20-04-2023.
