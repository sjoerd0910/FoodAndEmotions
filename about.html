            <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="aboutText"> There is a strong connection between taste and emotion. Different flavours can evoke
                different emotional
                responses in people. For example, the taste of sweet foods can often trigger feelings of happiness and
                contentment, while bitter flavours may trigger feelings of disgust. The sense of taste is closely tied
                to
                the
                sense of smell, and the combination of these two senses can have a powerful impact on how we experience
                food
                and
                drink, and how it makes us feel emotionally. Additionally, certain flavours and aromas may be associated
                with
                memories or experiences, which can also influence our emotional response to them.
                This project is based on the FaceReader data gathering sessions at TestLab, which was initiated to test
                out
                the
                FaceReader program and to investigate the link between tasting different flavours and changes in
                emotions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Assignment</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">
                The aim of this assignment is to use the data collected in the previous study, which examined consumer
                emotions in the tasting of cocktails. In this assignment, the presented data needs to be analysed. As a
                result, solutions will be provided about how the data can be presented in a clear manner to different
                audiences and to explain the results of this study by the means of visual artifacts.
            </p>
            <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Results</h4>
            <p class="aboutText">
                This project will be executed within the parameters given by the minor Data Visualisation. The results
                will consist of the following elements:
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp A portfolio where every step will be documented, and choices will be explained.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp An interactive visualization of the data in the form of a website.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp A poster presentation where the results of the project are presented.
            </p>
            <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Data</h3>
            <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Collection of the data</h4>
            <p class="aboutText">
                A dataset of 57 respondents is available on a cocktail experiment, performed by the Research Center
                Future
                of
                Food.
                <br> The data is collected by asking each participant to sit in front of a laptop. This laptop was
                running
                the
                FaceReader software which started recording once the process had been explained. Three samples of
                cocktails,
                a glass of water to drink in between cocktails and a questionnaire were set in front of the
                participants.
                The participants where then asked to sample each cocktail and fill out the questionnaire about the
                flavors
                tasted and the emotions felt. The participant was thanked for their participation and the FaceReader
                recording was stopped.
                <br> The FaceReader software produced per participant a dataset of 7 different emotions recorded every
                33
                milliseconds. Every emotion has a number ranging from 0 to 1 based on how strongly the FaceReader
                software
                measured that emotion on the participants face.
                <br> The total number of participants were 56 numbered 2 to 27, this was done because the first session
                was
                a
                trial conducted by the researcher to test the FaceReader software.
            </p>
            <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Neutralization of the data</h4>
            <p class="aboutText">
                Together with the 3 other project groups working on this project, we filtered the data. This was
                necessary
                because of the extreme large amount of data that was not usable for this project and the desired
                visualization.
                <br> In an excel sheet there were, depending on the length of the video, rows with measured emotions for
                every 33
                milliseconds. In the video there were times where the participant was smelling a cocktail, drinking a
                cocktail and writing down their experiences. The emotions measured at the moments where the participant
                was
                writing, are not interesting for the results in this project. By watching the videos individually, and
                writing down what time frames are not interesting, it was possible to filter these measurements out. In
                addition to this, timestamps needed to be added to the data marking when a participant is smelling a
                specific cocktail (cocktail 1, 2 or 3), and when a participant is drinking a specific cocktail. This
                part of
                filtering the data was done with all the project groups, dividing the work and working together made it
                possible to get the data within a few days in stead of a longer period.
                <br> To make the data even more usable for the specific need in this project. The faulty data was
                removed.
                There
                were a few moments were the FaceReader was not able to read the emotions correctly. Whether it came from
                the
                participant looking away or the reflection of glasses. This data was deleted, giving a smaller but more
                correct output.
                <br> In the end, the “smelling a cocktail” and “drinking a cocktail” event markers were merged in a
                “experiencing the cocktail” event marker. This was more suitable for the way the data is presented in
                this
                project. More about the presentation of the data can be found in the chapter Result and conclusion.

            <h3 class="aboutHeader3">Method</h3>
            <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Agile</h4>
            <p class="aboutText">
                The agile work method will be used in this project. This means that every week there will be a recap of
                what
                was done in the previous week, wat will be done in the next week, and if the project will succeed if
                this
                pace is being held up .
                <br> In addition, feedback and support will be provided every Thursday by the teachers.
            </p>
            <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Requirements</h4>
            <p class="aboutText">
                The requirements of the project are as following:
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp Data needs to be visualized in a way that it is clear to the viewer what is presented.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp Visualization needs to be made for a specific target audience.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp Different visualizations made for different target audiences.
                <br> <br> These are requirements that belong to the must have category. With that they automatically
                create
                the scope of the project.
            </p>
            <h4 class="aboutHeader4">Target audience</h4>
            <p class="aboutText">
                There were a few possible target audiences available in this project. The scientific audience, the
                consumers, the general public etc. Every individual project group was allowed to make the choice of
                target
                audience for themselves.
                <br> As a start, the group made a few sketches . These were not jet connected to a specific audience.
                Gradually
                it became clear that the main idea in the sketches was targeted to the scientific audience. In
                consultation
                with the product owner the decision was made to center only on the target audience “scientific
                audience”.
                The choices form the other groups (3 other groups) were taken in consideration. Luckily all the groups
                were
                divided among the choices.

            owner Dr. Danny Han we executed this project. This project took place from 06-02-2023 until 20-04-2023.
